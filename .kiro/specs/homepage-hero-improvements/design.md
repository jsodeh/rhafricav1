# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the improvements to the homepage hero section to create better visual alignment, modern styling, and improved user experience. The current hero section lacks visual consistency with the property carousels below, has inappropriate search recommendation behavior, uses outdated sharp-edged styling, and displays suboptimal heading text.

The design approach focuses on creating visual harmony between the hero content and property carousels, implementing modern rounded styling, fixing search UX issues, and updating the heading to better reflect the platform's value proposition. The solution maintains the existing React/TypeScript architecture while making targeted improvements to specific components.

## Architecture

### Layout Consistency System

The core architectural change involves establishing a consistent padding system between the hero section and property carousels:

**Current Structure Analysis:**
- Property carousels use: `container mx-auto px-4 max-w-7xl` (from Index.tsx line ~400)
- Hero section uses: `container mx-auto px-4` with `max-w-2xl` constraint
- This creates misalignment as the hero content is constrained to a smaller width

**New Alignment System:**
- Hero content container will match property carousel container exactly
- Both will use: `container mx-auto px-4 max-w-7xl`
- Hero content will be positioned within this container but maintain left alignment
- Responsive behavior will be consistent across both sections

### Search Interaction Architecture

**Current Behavior Issues:**
- LocationSearch component shows suggestions immediately on component mount when `searchQuery` is empty
- `showSmartSuggestions` is set to `true` in `handleInputFocus` when no search query exists
- This causes recommendations to appear without user interaction

**New Interaction Flow:**
- Suggestions will only appear after explicit user interaction (click or focus)
- Initial page load will not trigger any suggestion displays
- Focus state will be managed more precisely to prevent unwanted suggestion displays
- Both hero and sticky navigation search will have identical behavior

### Styling Architecture

**Border Radius System:**
- Current search input uses: `rounded-lg` (8px border radius)
- New design will use enhanced rounded styling: `rounded-xl` (12px border radius)
- Focus states will maintain rounded appearance
- Consistent with modern design patterns

**Typography Hierarchy:**
- Current heading: `text-3xl md:text-5xl` with "Agents. Tours. Loans. Homes."
- New heading: `text-4xl md:text-6xl` with "Africa's trusted real estate platform"
- Improved font weight and line height for better visual impact

## Components and Interfaces

### Enhanced Hero Section

```typescript
interface HeroSectionProps {
  // No props needed - component will be self-contained
}

interface HeroContentLayout {
  containerClass: string; // Matches property carousel container
  contentClass: string;   // Left-aligned content within container
  headingClass: string;   // Enhanced typography
  searchClass: string;    // Improved styling and positioning
}
```

**Design Specifications:**
- Container: `container mx-auto px-4 max-w-7xl` (matches PropertyCarousel)
- Content positioning: Left-aligned within the container
- Heading: Larger, more impactful typography
- Search bar: Enhanced rounded styling with proper spacing

### Improved LocationSearch Component

```typescript
interface LocationSearchProps {
  placeholder?: string;
  className?: string;
  onLocationSelect?: (location: string) => void;
  inputClassName?: string;
  preventAutoSuggestions?: boolean; // New prop to control suggestion behavior
}

interface SearchState {
  showSuggestions: boolean;
  showCurrentLocation: boolean;
  showSmartSuggestions: boolean;
  hasUserInteracted: boolean; // New state to track user interaction
}
```

**Design Specifications:**
- Enhanced border radius: `rounded-xl` instead of `rounded-lg`
- Improved interaction logic to prevent auto-suggestions
- Consistent behavior between hero and sticky navigation instances
- Better focus management and click-outside handling

### Updated StickyNavigation Integration

```typescript
interface StickyNavigationProps {
  isScrolled?: boolean;
  showSearchInNav?: boolean;
}
```

**Design Specifications:**
- Search component will use same improved LocationSearch
- Consistent suggestion behavior with hero search
- Maintained responsive behavior and styling

## Data Models

### Layout Configuration

```typescript
interface LayoutConfig {
  heroContainer: {
    className: string;
    maxWidth: string;
    padding: string;
  };
  propertyCarouselContainer: {
    className: string;
    maxWidth: string;
    padding: string;
  };
  alignment: {
    leftPadding: string;
    responsive: {
      mobile: string;
      tablet: string;
      desktop: string;
    };
  };
}
```

### Search Behavior Configuration

```typescript
interface SearchBehaviorConfig {
  autoSuggestions: boolean;
  showOnFocus: boolean;
  showOnClick: boolean;
  hideOnBlur: boolean;
  preventInitialDisplay: boolean;
}
```

### Typography Configuration

```typescript
interface TypographyConfig {
  hero: {
    heading: {
      text: string;
      className: string;
      responsive: {
        mobile: string;
        desktop: string;
      };
    };
  };
}
```

## Error Handling

### Layout Consistency Validation

**Responsive Breakpoint Handling:**
- Ensure alignment works across all screen sizes
- Graceful degradation for very small screens
- Consistent behavior when container constraints change

**Container Constraint Validation:**
- Verify max-width constraints are applied consistently
- Handle edge cases where content might overflow
- Maintain alignment even with dynamic content

### Search Interaction Error Prevention

**Focus Management:**
- Prevent suggestion display on initial page load
- Handle rapid focus/blur events gracefully
- Ensure click-outside behavior works consistently

**State Management:**
- Prevent race conditions in suggestion display
- Handle component unmounting during interaction
- Maintain consistent state between hero and sticky search

## Testing Strategy
