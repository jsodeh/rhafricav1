# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the homepage hero section to better match modern real estate platform design patterns, specifically addressing layout consistency, search UX issues, and visual hierarchy problems. The current hero section has inconsistent padding with the rest of the page content, displays search recommendations inappropriately, uses sharp-edged styling, and has suboptimal heading text. The goal is to create a cohesive, professional homepage experience that matches industry standards like Zillow while maintaining the existing functionality.
