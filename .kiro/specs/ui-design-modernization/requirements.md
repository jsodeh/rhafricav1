# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on modernizing the user interface design of the real estate platform to address current visual and usability issues. The current design appears outdated with a "1960s box design" aesthetic, has transparency issues causing content overlap, inconsistent component heights, and a system health monitor that's inappropriately visible to all users. The goal is to create a modern, cohesive, and professional interface that maintains the existing application structure while significantly improving the visual design and user experience.
