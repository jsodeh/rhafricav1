### 5. Environment Variables
Ensure your Netlify environment variables are set:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### 6. Auth Flow Routes
Your app now supports these auth routes:

- `/auth/callback` - Handles all auth callbacks (signup, login, OAuth)
- `/auth/confirm` - Email confirmation success page
- `/auth/reset-password` - Password reset form

### 7. Testing the Flow

#### Sign Up Flow:
1. User signs up at `/signup`
2. Receives email with confirmation link
3. Clicks link â†’ redirected to `/auth/callback?type=signup`
4. App processes confirmation â†’ redirects to `/onboarding`

#### Password Reset Flow:
1. User requests reset at `/login`
2. Receives email with reset link
3. Clicks link â†’ redirected to `/auth/reset-password`
4. User sets new password â†’ redirected to `/dashboard`

#### Login Flow:
1. User logs in at `/login`
2. If successful â†’ redirected to `/dashboard`
3. If email not confirmed â†’ shown confirmation message

### 8. Security Considerations

- All URLs use HTTPS in production
- Wildcards (`/**`) allow deep linking after auth
- Tokens are handled securely by Supabase
- Session management is automatic

### 9. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:
- **"Invalid redirect URL"** â†’ Check URL is added to Redirect URLs list
- **"Email not confirmed"** â†’ Check email template redirect URLs
- **"Token expired"** â†’ Email links expire after 24 hours by default
- **"Redirect loop"** â†’ Ensure Site URL matches your domain exactly

#### Debug Steps:
1. Check browser network tab for auth requests
2. Verify environment variables in Netlify
3. Test with incognito/private browsing
4. Check Supabase logs in dashboard

### 10. Email Template Customization

You can customize the email templates in Supabase Dashboard:
- Add your branding/logo
- Customize the message text
- Ensure redirect URLs point to your domain

### 11. Next Steps

After configuration:
1. Deploy your updated app to Netlify
2. Test signup flow with a real email
3. Test password reset flow
4. Verify all redirects work correctly
5. Monitor Supabase auth logs for any issues
